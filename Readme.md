IDEAS
=====
* Build a list of letter occurrences based on Scrabble values (a list of 27 integers).
	* To generate random letters based on occurrence, we generate a list of letters based on the following algorithm:
		MAX_OCC = 10
		for l in occ_list:
			for c in range(l):
				letter_list.append(MAX_OCC - letters[l])
		Then we get random values from the letter_list.
	* If we decide not to use "final" letters, then their occurrence should be MAX_OCC.
* Move from Pickle store to a database (sqlite):
	* I need a database schema. It needs to have a table for configurations and hold a row for version of the schema.
	* The version row should always be written last so that if the db transaction fails it will be easy to recognize.
	* When opening the database file I need to check for the version.
	* The bottle microframework has a sqlite plugin, I should use it
* Use an online service for spellchecking, and if doesn't exist, use emscripten to convert hspell to a JS library.
* Allow users to add words to the dictionary
